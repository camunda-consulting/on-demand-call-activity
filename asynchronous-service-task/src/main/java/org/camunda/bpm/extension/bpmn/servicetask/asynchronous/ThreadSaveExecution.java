/**
 * <p>An implementation of {@link DelegateExecution} that can be safely passed to
 * another thread because it is disconnected from the engine and its entities.
 * It provides a {@link #complete()} method to signal back to the execution
 * that it was started with assuming that that is in a wait state.</p>
 *
 * <p>Setters for variables must be used to set new or update existing variables.
 * Removing variables and modifying local variables is not supported and the
 * methods for that have been marked as deprecated to indicate that.</p>
 *
 * <p>In general, any method of the {@link DelegateExecution} interface that does
 * not work in another thread will throw {@link UnsupportedOperationException}
 * when it is invoked at runtime. Please ensure full unit test coverage of any
 * code that uses this class to avoid any surprises at runtime.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link DelegateExecution} interface is implemented in order to provide a
 * familiar programming model and ensure feature coverage as good as possible
 * in multi-threaded environment. Nevertheless, the implementation of that
 * interface has to be considered best-effort and compiler safety is limited.</p>
